# This repo
Tools + datasets for opening up data from parliament website. 


# Origin
Started when I saw official government statistics in PDF files, and assessed that it would be faster to unlock the data myself than ask official channels to do anything about it. Ping me if you have related ideas / projects.


# Goal
Set a data-driven playground for a political dashboard (attempt at assessing if our institutions and representatives work for us), maybe some predictive capability if it makes sense.


# Datasets
