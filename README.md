# parliament_of_australia
A set of tools and datasets for opening up data from parliament website. Started when I saw official government statistics in PDF files, and evaluated that it would be faster to unlock the data myself than ask official channels to do anything anout it. Ping me if you have related ideas / projects.

# Datasets
